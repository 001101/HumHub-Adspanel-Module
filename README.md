# [HumHub](https://github.com/humhub/humhub) Adspanel

This module is for HumHub Version 0.20+ (Yii 2) and cant be used with older versions!

## Description

This module adds a simple ads slider widget to humhub`s sidebar.  By default I integrated 6 slides.

## Slides/Image integration
**You have to integrate the slides manually**. 
To do it open **protected/modules/adspanel/widgets/views/adframe.php** near **line 11** and replace the demo slides/images, the caption texts (H2) and also the demo humhub links with Your content.
**You need very basic knowledge in CSS and HTML or PHP.**

## Caution!!!
**Do not forget to set Your Ad Blocker browser AddOn to Off on Your website**

Widget works on spaces, dashboard and profile.

## Installation
1. Download the module and upload it to your modules directory protected/modules
2. Rename module directory ```adspanel```
3. Enable module from >Admin>Modules
